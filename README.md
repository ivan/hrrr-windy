# HRRR Windy

This is a userscript that clicks the "HRRR" button at the bottom of Windy.com, defaulting you to the 3km resolution HRRR forecast instead of the 9km resolution ECMWF forecast.

Not affiliated with Windy.

## Install

This is distributed as a userscript, so you need a browser extension that runs userscripts.

[Violentmonkey](https://violentmonkey.github.io/) can be installed in Firefox and Chromium-based browsers. [Userscripts](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/userscripts/id1463298887) works in Safari.

Then, visit [hrrr_windy.user.js](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ludios/hrrr-windy/master/hrrr_windy.user.js) and _Confirm installation_.

(Alternatively, create a new script and paste in the entire <code>hrrr_windy.user.js</code> source.)
